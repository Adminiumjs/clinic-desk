/**
 * How the website demo's card reaches into a screen: a named signal, with an
 * optional payload, that the screen it names listens for.
 *
 * The card's shortcuts ("Returning patient", "Someone takes this time",
 * "Jump to now") act on a screen's own state — a form being filled, the day
 * sheet's scroll — which no store holds. So the demo's bridge SENDS a signal
 * and the screen, if it is showing, does the thing. In every other build
 * nothing ever sends one: a screen's listener costs a subscription and does
 * nothing, and this file carries no demo data or words of its own.
